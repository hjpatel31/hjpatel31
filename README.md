### ðŸ‘€ What Makes Me Tick...
**Electronics Enthusiast**: I get a kick out of understanding how devices work, whether itâ€™s soldering circuits or building IoT devices. Thereâ€™s something about making things "smarter" that never gets old.

**Problem Solver**: Codingâ€™s my jam! Whether itâ€™s developing web apps, automating tasks, or creating tools, Iâ€™m all about finding simple solutions to tricky problems.

**Cloud Climber**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud â€“ Iâ€™m fascinated by how cloud platforms make everything scalable and secure. Iâ€™m learning to use these tools to build systems that can handle anything.

**AI Explorer**: Iâ€™m diving into Machine Learning and AI with a passion for making predictions, automating tasks, and exploring the ethical side of tech. I'm all about using AI responsibly and creatively.
