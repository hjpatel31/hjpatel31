### Hi there, I’m Heli Patel! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where code meets curiosity! I’m a tech-loving, circuit-soldering, bug-busting student at Seneca College, on a mission to master Computer Engineering Technology. Let’s connect, geek out, and build something amazing!

### 👀 What Makes Me Tick...
**Electronics Enthusiast**: Ever wondered what makes your devices tick? I do, too—daily! I love diving into the electrifying world of circuits and embedded systems, where even the smallest resistor can make or break a project. IoT? I'm all for making "smart" things smarter.

**Code Crafter**: Give me a problem, and I’ll code a solution! From web apps to open-source magic, I’m all about creating software that’s useful, fun, and slightly addictive. If there’s code involved, I’m probably excited about it.

**Cloud Climber**: Why keep your stuff on one computer when you can put it in *the cloud*? With a fascination for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, I’m learning how to leverage the mystical powers of cloud platforms to keep applications scalable, secure, and ready for anything.

**AI Adventurer**: I’m diving headfirst into Machine Learning and AI, eager to build models that predict the future (or at least recommend what to binge-watch next). Beyond the code, I'm exploring the ethical side of AI because power without responsibility just isn’t cool.

### 🌱 What I'm Growing...
**Advanced Programming Muscles**: Flexing my C++, Python, and Java skills to tackle gnarly algorithms, elegant data structures, and design patterns. My ultimate goal? Becoming a lean, mean, problem-solving machine.

**Network Know-How**: Learning the ins and outs of IT infrastructure, from network security to troubleshooting. I’m your go-to person if your Wi-Fi ever feels “sluggish”—or if you need advice on packet-sniffing (for legal purposes, of course).

**Tech Trends Detective**: I’m committed to staying tech-savvy and in the loop with the latest buzz in AI, ML, and beyond. I’m always up for a good online course binge or a workshop marathon—especially if there's coffee involved!

### 😄 Let's Team Up!
I’m eager to jump into:
- **Open-source projects** with a dash of innovation and a sprinkle of software development or cloud computing.
- **Research initiatives** that blend hardware, software, and a bit of good old-fashioned problem-solving.

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
If there's a DIY gadget in my house, I probably built it (or took it apart and forgot how to put it back together). From custom electronics to quirky code experiments, I’m all about bringing ideas to life—one resistor, line of code, and late-night brainstorm at a time.

Let’s make some tech magic together! 🚀
